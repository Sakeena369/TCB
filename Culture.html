                Red White and Royal Blue, based on the famous bestseller by Casey McQuiston of the same name,
                hit India on August 11th on Amazon Prime and immediately endeared itself to us.
                <br><br>
                The movie follows the love story of Alex Claremont-Diaz, the son of a US presidential 
                candidate, played by Taylor Zakhar Perez and Prince Henry, the spare prince of the UK 
                as Nicholas Galtizine. The movie, clearly a romcom, is a step away from the usual queer 
                romances, where director Matthew López concentrates on the blooming love between Alex 
                and Henry, instead of the many political issues they could have caused. 
                <br><br>
                With the help of cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt, López brought us the transformation of a 
                cheeky couple from bitter enemies to passionate lovers. Their playful chemistry has us sold 
                immediately. In that vein, it allows Alex and Henry to be open about their relationship, including 
                a portrayal of their steadily growing intimacy. They may struggle with what it implies for their 
                families but are aware of who they are as people and what they want for their lives as a public 
                couple. The casting showcases itself as a melting pot of ethnicities, races, and cultures interacting
                naturally. Every character is utterly believable on their own. 
                <br><br>
                However, it is still a fairy tale, and there are plot devices that are simply too convenient.
                The tenderness between Perez and Galitzine, on the other hand, encourages a very willing 
                suspension of disbelief, which is what happily ever after is all about.

              If Chatgpt hasn’t taken over
                your world yet, you are doing it wrong. Actually, scratch
                that. If AI has not taken over
                your college life yet, well,
                you are kind of living under a
                rock. We all agree AI has been
                a game-changer, used so frequently that it is always open in
                our browsers. But if you are a
                first-timer who has not explored
                the field of educational technology yet, we’ll equip you with
                just the right ones!
                <br><br>
                Starting off with Factgpt
                (chatgpt’s cousin) by Longshot
                AI, you no longer have to break
                your head over finding citations
                for your research papers because it will do all that for you.
                Next up, we got Notion AI. I
                personally recommend using
                this because my notes have never
              looked better and my brain
              no longer shuts down right after
              opening my books.
              A life-saver indeed, (and to the
              person who suggested it to me,
              you deserve a vending machine
              treat).

              Semester finals aren’t really
              complete without the professors
              asking for presentations. So
              here’s Tome AI, where you can
              make PPTs that can guarantee
              you one mark more than what
              you got last semester.
              Well, these do not end here.
              There are multiple apps and
              websites ( paid or free) out there
              that will ease your burden. But
              remember, only use these in
              times when you are sure you
              won’t caught by your teachers.
              Otherwise, use your skills as a
              last resort.
