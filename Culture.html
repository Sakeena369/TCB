                    On July 21, the world was exposed to the ‘Barbenheimer’ phenomenon, where Nolan’s
                    ‘Oppenheimer’ and Gerwig’s ‘Barbie’, were released on the same day, following some truly
                    inspiring marketing. This begs the question to be asked… Were they worth the hype?
                    <br><br>
                    Greta Gerwig’s ‘Barbie’ tried to tackle many issues in its 2 hour run time, such as sexism,
                    patriarchy, and existential crises. Many viewers came back calling the movie “anti-man”, but the
                    movie focuses on squashing patriarchy, rather than any particular gender. It is made clear that
                    Barbieland doesn’t care about the Kens but that is supposed to make you recognize how silly it
                    is to treat one gender better.
                    <br><br>
                    Instead of truly telling us the story of how Barbie&#39;s existence affected the lives of many girls and
                    women, we are given unnecessary dance sequences (with iconic songs) and feminist speeches
                    by America Ferrera that raised goosebumps the first time around but resulted in rolled eyes the
                    third time around.
                    <br><br>
                    On the other hand, we had the complete antithesis of Barbie: the famed Christopher Nolan’s
                    ‘Oppenheimer’. When you leave your seats after ‘Oppenheimer’, you are left shocked. In awe.
                    The movie had a disjointed timeline, which almost made one think they were looking into the
                    mind of Oppenheimer himself, with its beautiful visuals and powerful sound effects. It is when
                    you think about it the next day that you see its small cracks.
                    <br><br>
                    We think back to Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt’s characters, and how these award-winning
                    actresses were sidelined in the movie, even though they influenced and impacted
                    Oppenheimer’s life. Also with so much happening at the same time, or in quick succession to
                    one another, in many ways, it just made the audience feel lost and dumb.
                    <br><br>
                    On the whole, I truly believe that both ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ were amazing movies. They
                    accomplished what they set out to do, and while there will always be some sort of criticism to
                    give, these movies have impacted people in ways nobody could have imagined and is not
                    something that will be forgotten anytime soon. So now the question falls upon you. Do you think
                    they lived up to the hype?

                    These are the words Prithvi Raj, the owner of the new Thindi House swears by. Previously famous to everyone as Puppy’s Gastronomy, the transformation to this unique style has seemed to welcome a whole new community to their restaurant. What started as a means to bring their travel experiences to one place and call it home has now grown to become a place of their roots. <br><br>
                    Indian cuisine is such that people claim it to be their comfort zone, a safe haven of sorts. And, that is exactly what the Thindi House aims to be. Combining healthy and nostalgia, (a dealbreaker, might I add) they cater to a variety of the South Indian food we all know and love. Well, the plans do not stop here! Inclusivity is the trend and the restaurant is also planning to incorporate other cuisines, such as North Indian, Chinese, and everyone’s favorites, Chats. Not restricting themselves to just serving food, Thindi House wants to serve an experience, and so they also plan to cater chaat counters for fests, starting with IRIS, the annual fest for MCC PU.<br><br>                         To improve is to change; and that’s what Thindi House constantly works towards. With the new introductions of meal plans, they want to keep in mind the proximity of the college and implement the 3H’s, healthy, homely, and hearty. Coming up with a teachers meal plan and possibly for the  PG students as well, the restaurant sure is very excited for everyone to try them out! Forms are available at the front desk so if you are interested, go on and check it out. Don't miss out on the opportunity to indulge in their culinary creations – a journey to create an explosion of flavours. <br>
