                  Urban legends are considered
                  a genre of modern folklore that
                  usually consist of rare and exceptional events. They are stories told as true, and possible
                  enough to be believed and are
                  usually about an exceptional
                  event that happened to a real
                  person or in a real place. These
                  stories are rooted in historical
                  facts, describing adventures of
                  people who once actually lived,
                  but whose adventures have been
                  greatly exaggerated through the
                  passage of time.

                    <br>
                    Kuldhara village in Rajasthan
                    was abandoned overnight, leaving behind a shambles of homes
                    and buildings. According to legend, the monarch of the territory fell in love with the daughter
                    of the subjugated village leader,
                    and in order to avoid shame,
                    the entire village of 1500 vanished overnight. According to
                    legend, the village chief cursed
                    the abandoned village in such
                    a way that anyone who tried to
                    live there would perish.

                  <b>Karnataka:</b>
                  In the 1990s, there were stories
                  of a witch wandering the streets
                  late at night, knocking on doors
                  and calling out to victims in
                  the voice of their mother. The
                  individual died if the door was
                  answered. The solution was
                  to put “Nale ba” on the door,
                  which means “come tomorrow,” implying that the witch
                  would return the next day, see
                  the sign, and the cycle would
                  continue. The 2018 Bollywood
                  film ‘Stree’, starring Shraddha
                  Kapoor and Rajkumar Rao,
                  is based on the Naale Baa tale
                  from Karnataka.

                  Delhi is famous for its ancient
                  and twisty banyan trees. Hikers have reported witnessing a
                  woman dressed in white, wandering among the banyan trees
                  before disappearing.

                       <br>
                       Many years ago, Jatinga in Assam, garnered news due to bird
                        suicides, and many people associated it with the supernatural.
                        For those who are unfamiliar
                        with Jatinga’s Bird Suicide,
                        birds come soaring at night and
                        drop dead on the ground every
                        year from September to November. For many years, residents
                        and those who heard about it
                        through word of mouth treated
                        it as an otherworldly event, attracting numerous researchers
                        from throughout the world.

                    The world of urban legends is
                    a place where reality and fantasy collides, blurring the line between the two. While scepticism
                    and critical thinking are useful
                    skills for separating facts from
                    fiction, urban legends’ allure
                    lies in their ability to stimulate
                    our curiosity and spur discussion. In the end, it’s up to each
                    person to choose whether to
                    embrace the magic and mystery
                    of urban legends or to approach
                    them with more scepticism.

                  Bollywood’s attempts at
                  sex comedies, which explore
                  women’s desires, have always had to navigate a tricky
                  audience, especially with the
                  subjects they approach. If you
                  have seen similar movies/series such as ‘Lipstick Under
                  My Burkha’ and ‘Four More
                  Shots Please’, you’ll know what
                  I am talking about. And that is
                  exactly why ‘‘Thank you for
                  Coming’ turns out to be an interesting watch, to say the least.
                  Sex comedies can be a revolutionary genre— especially in
                  a country like India, where sex
                  is considered as a taboo subject.
                  However, this film doesn’t start
                  any revolutions; in fact, there’s
                  a series of jumbled repetition
                  of feminist clichés to make one
                  cringe at best and feel pompous
                  at worst.
                  The Karan Boolani directed
                  movie stars Bhumi Pednekar as
                  Kanika Kapoor, the protagonist
                  who well into her 30s, desperately searches for an orgasm.
                  Natasha Rastogi, Kanika’s single mother, chose to have her
                  daughter as an unmarried woman. However, Kanika does not
                  want to follow in her mother’s
                  footsteps and finds herself on a
                  man-hunt throughout her entire
                  life.
                  The film admittedly had its
                  funny moments, as is expected
                  of the cast it contains, such as
                  Anil Kapoor playing Kanika’s
                  older ex-boyfriend, her fiancé
                  Jeevan Anand (whose name is
                  literally translated to Life Insurance Policy) and Shehnaz Gill’s
                  witty desi one-liners.
                   The film’s issues lie within its
                  script, which introduces strange
                  plot twists, leaves them unexplored, and is unable to develop the characters as believable,
                  three-dimensional people who
                  have actual relationships with
                  each other outside Kanika’s intimate life.
                   The climax feels like a rather forced moral ending, which
                  seals my opinion of this movie.
                  Sure, it suits the audience as an
                  entertaining one-time watch,
                  but as a reviewer, I can only see
                  it as a landmine of missed opportunities.
