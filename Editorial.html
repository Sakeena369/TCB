            we must look to see if breaking the fourth wall is in order too. <b>Will the hopes of the people with one

              <h2 class="text-center">The Battle for the Ideal Nest Away from the Nest</h2>
              <p>You spend most of your school days imagining how it feels to move out of your home and make your own choices. With the same dreams,
                 we seek places to live after we move out of the comfort of our homes, 
                only for them to be crushed when we consider the options available and the challenges of finding an accessible place to live off-campus.
                <br><br>Rents in cities have risen by about 40% in the past year, making it difficult for students and other working professionals to find a place to live.
                 While bachelors struggle to locate good residences within their budget, paying-guest housing has also experienced between a 25 to 40 percent increase in rentals.
                  The Bengaluru bench of the ‘Authority for Advance Ruling’ stated they intend to impose 12 percent GST on PG and student housing for rates less than Rs 1,000 per night. 
                <br><br>While PGs/hostels appear as a more viable choice when you first move out, they come with their own set of constraints. When you relocate from your house to a tight space 
                with little regard for boundaries, adapting to changes takes time and that takes a toll on your mental health. Living with roommates who have different opinions and do not share
                 your regard for hygiene is also an inconvenience. The primary issue with PGs is the bland and repetitive meals, which lead to eating out, which just adds to student expenditure. 
                While apartments may appear to be a more liberating option, they come with significant commitments. <br><br>
                Every place, whether PG or apartment, has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, but relocating to a new location is a transition that each of us must
                 acclimate to on our own time. No location will ever meet all of your expectations when you move in, but you work with the resources you have and build a place to call as your new home.

              <h2 class="text-center">Bodies as a site of structural violence and in turn, protest</h2>
              <p>Women have been caught up in a relentless amount of body politics for decades, and have reached the point of unfazed composure when
                 presented with the violence in the world against women. The question that can’t help but be voiced is how much closer have we really brought women to a safer reality? <br><br>
                 Throughout history, structural violence against women has persisted as a devastating weapon in times of war. Prominent examples, such as the 2002 Gujarat riots and the recent Manipur
                  incident, demonstrate how sexual violence has been employed during communal/ethnic clashes. Using women's bodies as tools to further political goals has been dismissed as mere "collateral damage," 
                  denying them the recognition and respect they rightly deserve for their unintended involvement in these conflicts.
                 <br><br>The act of rape continues to be used to control, degrade, and manipulate women. To establish their authority, men from various communities may engage in the violation of women,
                  thus contributing to the extensive and all-encompassing prevalence of this issue. Patriarchy and entitlement of men are so deeply rooted in society that many men arrogantly believe that
                   laying a hand upon a woman lies well within their “right” as a man. <br><br>
                   The link between violence and lower caste only adds to the complexity of this issue. People have often expressed how in the social hierarchy, the men have it good, the women have it bad and the lower caste women have it worse. 
                   <br><br>Unfortunately, society and the government have both shown that they are unable to adequately protect the rights of women in the nation. In order to ensure the safety, dignity, and equality of all women, regardless of 
                   their background, it is critical for us as a culture to confront these ingrained issues.
