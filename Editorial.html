                <br>
                <img src="neps.png" alt="movie"  class="rounded image" style="height:35.1rem; width:42rem;">  
                <br><br>
                <p class="para justify-text-center">
                    

                  In a whirlwind of policy changes, the National Education Policy (NEP) was initiated and subsequently
                  withdrawn in Karnataka, leaving students in a state of uncertainty. The rollercoaster ride of the NEP
                  in Karnataka has raised important questions about the motivations behind its implementation and withdrawal,
                  as well as its implications for students, particularly those in their final year.

                  <br><br>
                  The withdrawal of the NEP in August brought in at the inception of the new government's budget in the state
                  has sparked contentious debates about whether these actions were driven by genuine concern for students or
                  were merely part of a political agenda. Proponents of the NEP argue that its implementation aimed to revamp the system,
                  aligning education with the needs of the 21st century. It sought to enhance the quality of education, emphasizing critical 
                  thinking and multidisciplinary education in order to benefit students in the long run.

                  <br><br>
                  Alternatively, critics, including the Congress government led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, contended that the NEP was 
                  implemented haphazardly. They argued that the BJP government's decision to roll out the NEP was driven more by political considerations
                   than the interests of students. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah further alleged that BJP had sacrificed students' interests for an experimental policy
                    that wasn't implemented uniformly across all states.

                  
                  <br><br>
                  As the NEP was withdrawn, questions about the State Education Policy (SEP) have emerged. What will it entail and how will it differ from the NEP?
                  Unfortunately, the current state of clarity on the SEP is akin to a foggy morning, with many details yet to be unveiled. Educators are unsure of the educational
                  landscape they will face in the coming years. Perhaps the most affected group are the final-year students who had the 4th year option snatched from them. 
                  These students are now pushed up by a year, compelled to hurriedly make and follow up on applications for jobs and further studies. The pressure is immense and the trepidation, palpable.
                  This sudden modification in their academic journey leaves them grappling with uncertainty.


                    
                  <br><br>
                  It's crucial to recognize that both the Congress and BJP have their merits and demerits in this situation. The BJP's intent to modernize education may have been well-intentioned,
                  but the rushed implementation without adequate groundwork has resulted in chaos and opposition. On the other hand, the Congress government's withdrawal of the NEP has left many 
                  questioning its commitment to education reform and whether political motives influenced the decision. The central concern that emerges from this NEP saga is whether it is fair
                  for a political agenda to put students in such a situation of uncertainty. Education should ideally be a realm of stability and growth. We must ponder: should students bear the brunt
                  of policy experiments and power plays?

                  <br><br>
                  CM Siddaramaiah's assertion that they need more time to prepare for a new policy and will use the old system until the new one is ready appears sensible on the surface. However, 
                  this justification must be weighed against the fact that students have already been subjected to abrupt shifts in their paths. A counterpoint might argue that adequate preparation
                  should have been a prerequisite before initiating such a policy change.


                  <br><br>
                  The debate over the motivations behind these actions continues. As we grapple with the aftermath, the central question remains: 
                  Is it fair for students to be pawns in the political chessboard? The fog surrounding education in Karnataka must lift and the well-being
                  of students should remain at the forefront of any present or future educational reforms.

                  World Suicide Prevention Day, observed annually on September 10th, is a somber occasion this year as Kota mourns the loss of 20 young 
                  lives to suicide in the last eight months.



                  <br><br>
                  Annually, over two lakh students flock to Rajasthan's coaching hub for the JEE and NEET exams. Kota grapples with a high student suicide rate, 
                  often ignored until two students tragically ended their lives on 27 Aug 2023. In response, the Kota administration mandated the installation of spring-loaded 
                  fans and "anti-suicide nets" in hostels- a move that faced criticism.


                  <br><br>
                  Many believe that the focus should shift towards prioritizing mental health and creating a supportive environment for students, rather than relying solely on safety 
                  equipment as a preventive measure. The current emphasis on short-term solutions, like safety measures for moments of crisis, falls short of addressing the root problem 
                  of suicide prevention. Real change necessitates systemic reform and expert guidance.


                  
                  <br><br>
                  Authorities have temporarily suspended routine assessments in coaching institutes for competitive exam preparation for the next two months. However, 
                  it's clear that this alone won't bring about significant systemic changes within such a short timeframe. While adopting suicide prevention equipment is beneficial, 
                  it should not be the sole reliance. Although it's challenging to enact long-term systemic change in a matter of weeks, the process should commence promptly to facilitate gradual transformation.



                    
                  <br><br>
                  India faces a grim reality with suicide ranking fourth among the leading causes of death in young people. Establishing a national suicide prevention policy is crucial to prioritize mental health. 
                  To prevent extreme actions driven by academic pressure, both the education system and societal expectations must undergo reform. Students should be encouraged to embrace failure and personal growth 
                  without fear of undue consequences.

              <p class="para justify-text-center">
              Freedom of Expression is one of the absolute principles by which any democracy swears. So why is it that institutions which run on these very principles,
              find loopholes to work around it day by day? What serves as the simplest form of representation for young adults?
              Clothing. Those who deny it as a form of expression may just find themselves at the receiving end of backlash by GenZ, or in straightforward terms,
              just normal college students. A noticeable change witnessed has been the uniformed guards who check the clothing of every student entering the premises. 
              If you are a first year, this may not come as a surprise to you but to others, this is an action we are not accustomed to. There are suddenly more eyes
              on you every day, and we dare say, it is the uncomfortable kind. 



                <br><br>
                A major concern leaving the students preoccupied is the removal of the abaya right at the college gates. There have been questions arising whether
                it is absolutely necessary on the college’s part to do so. The authorities state that this implementation has always been around, 
                but it is only this year that they began outsourcing to tighten its place. Could this be a part of the new drive that the college is doing for a status change?
                Whether it is or not, this issue has mixed reactions.
