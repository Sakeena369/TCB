                        Fabil Abdullakutty, a graduate in public policy made history as MCC’s first male graduate. 
                        MCC, mostly known for its all-female students, first welcomed male students for its master’s courses. Fabil did his 
                        undergraduate degree in BCom at Christ College in Kerala and currently works at “Haqdarshak”.

                        <b> Q: Can you tell me a little about yourself?</b>
                        <br>
                        A: I’m from Thrissur, I studied in Kerala, throughout my school years and undergrad, and 
                        for post-graduation in public policy, I moved to Bangalore. I currently work in Kerala.

                        <b>Q: How did you end up coming to MCC?</b>
                        <br>
                            A: I was writing some government exams, but things didn’t work well. I thought about going into the social sector. I started looking for what I wanted to 
                            do and I found public policy! I got accepted into other universities, but my parents weren’t 
                            keen on sending me all the way to places like Mumbai, Sonipat, Haryana...that’s when I applied to MCC.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Q: Did you know when applying that MCC is an all-girls college?</b>
                        <br>
                            A: I didn’t know about it, I just saw that they were offering an MA in public policy and I went 
                            for it. After the interview, I got to know that it was a women’s college. I mean Bangalore is 
                            close to Kerala, it’s convenient. Little did I know that I would be creating history by being 
                            MCC’s first male graduate.

                      <b>Q: How did it feel to be one of the first male students?</b>
                        <br>
                            A: All my teachers and the staff were very supportive. They never excluded me, instead, 
                            they were protective of me. That really helped me get through my 2 years of college. They pampered me a lot. I’m still in touch 
                            with my teachers. 
                        <br><br>

                        <br>
                            A:  It was good! The course had various departments come to teach us – Journalism, Economics, Political Science, etc. 
                            It gave me opportunities to do field work and exposure. Plus the student council did a very 
                            good job. I really liked the atmosphere, it gave me a good feeling. 
                        <br><br>
