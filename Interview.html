            <br><br>
            <p class="para text-justify">Dr. George Lekha, is the ninth Principal of Mount Carmel College, Autonomous.
                Propelled with a need to give back, this year marks her thirty-second year being a
                part of the college. In this riveting conversation with Sravya Satpathy, she talks about
                what lies ahead in the future of MCC and what she brings to the table.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-3">
                    <p class="para">
                          <b>Q) You have been a part of the college for a long time now, so what are some
                            changes relative to MCC that have taken place in your time here?</b> 
                            <br><br>
                            R) There are a lot. Increasing in population to 8500 students now, getting autonomy,
                            adopting the semester system, and now with NEP, the institution has definitely
                            grown. Our college&#39;s success has also contributed to the fact that we went from 23 to
                            70 courses, introduced PG programs, been recognised as a research centre, and
                            introduced sustainability as part of our daily lives. These are some of the structural
                            changes that took place. On a personal note, I find establishing rapport with the
                            students is more difficult now. It was easier to do so back when we had all the time in
                            the world. But, being a mentor has always been more important to me compared to academics.

                            <b>Q) Thirty-two years is a very long commitment to make. With your
                            credentials, anyone would have loved to have you as a part of their
                            institution – so why Mount Carmel?</b>
                            <br><br>
                            R) What I am today, I owe it all to MCC. I was a different person as a 23-year old here in
                            1991. My confidence is credited to this college. I want to pay her back with my best
                            with all my years before retirement. And, I have an excellent team to help with that!

                           <b>Q) Your profile in the official website of Mount Carmel mentions that one of
                            your core driving principles is a propagation of Aristotle. How are you
                            planning on inculcating this into a large demographic like that of Mount
                            Carmel’s?</b>
                            <br><br>
                            R) Collaborating and working as a group is what I stress on, especially for the PG
                            students. The college, as a whole, is definitely not going to be a walk in the park, but
                            if any concerns are brought to me, I will make it a point to sensitize as it matters
                            more to me.

                            <br><br>
                            Student encouragement and their love. My first batch of ‘91 was a struggle but I
                            pushed through with my students cheering. The lack of age gap meant that they
                            could understand my perspective quite well. I’m still in contact with them and I can
                            confidently say they are the happiest bunch I have taught.

                            R) Obviously, Cul-ah but Freshers week is also a close favorite as we get to identify new talent.

                            R) I remember hostelites coming into class with hundreds of bindis on their face and carrying books in buckets.

                            R) Rewind definitely, the younger days were that good. There’s this satisfying feeling
                            that comes after a well prepared lecture. Nothing can top that.

                            R) I am very content with my profession because I feel it keeps you young. But in the
                            younger days, I wanted to do medicine and become a doctor.
