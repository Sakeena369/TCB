            <br><br>
            <p class="para text-center">We often view our teachers solely in their role but rarely consider that they too have come from
            the place we are currently in. Tracing our thoughts, literally, we asked alumni teachers about
            their experience transitioning from students to educators on the same campus. They had many
            nostalgic moments to share. Here is what they said!</p>

                            R) “I have a deeper familiarity with the environment and its inner workings, which made my
                                transition into a teaching role smoother and allowed me to navigate the system effortlessly,
                                giving me an edge over my colleagues.”

                                “I had ample opportunities to learn from mistakes during my initial days. The unconditional
                                support and forgiveness, especially during my year of mentorship, have been invaluable for my

                            R) “In essence, it&#39;s like seeing a reflection of my own past as a student and gaining a deeper
                            understanding of what teachers must have felt when I was on the other side.”

                            R) “ I vividly recall those initial moments when students would address me as “ma&#39;am” and I&#39;d think
                            to myself, “Are they talking to me?” Being a teacher here has unveiled a whole new dimension

                            subtle shift—a unique aspect that kept drawing me back.”
