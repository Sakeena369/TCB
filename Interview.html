                          <b>“Though I’m 78, I always consider myself to be a sweet sixteen going on seventeen,”</b>
                           she said, looking at me fondly from across her table a few years ago. A kind figure draped in her simple
                           saree, Sister Genevieve sat at the head of the table. She had the spirit of a teenager, the wisdom
                           of age, and the knowledge of the world.
                          <br><br>
                          Today, I sit writing this article, the editor of a college newspaper, a journalism major, and a
                          literature fanatic. I walked into Sister’s office as a 16-year-old, with the idea of taking commerce
                          but then Sister asked me what I do. I had written a book? She wanted a copy. I run a business?
                          She wanted a card. I was the head girl of my school? She wanted to know how leadership shaped me.
                          <br><br>
                          Convinced as she was by the end of that conversation, Sister offered me a seat in an arts course.
                          Stubborn as I was, I thought I knew what I wanted. Sister told me to take a minute to think about
                          it. I stepped out, then I stepped back in ready to refuse the seat. It was then that Sister took my
                          hand and became a mentor for me for my next few years at Mount Carmel. I walked out of the
                          room, registered for the arts course, and am happier than ever.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <p class="para">
                      Sister’s memory was impeccable. She remembered my mother from almost 20 years earlier as
                      her principal. If she didn’t forget my mother, it was a long shot that she would keep her eye off me.
                      <br><br>
                      Throughout my first year at Mount Carmel pre-university, Sister would find me in a corridor,
                      bunking class, or walking in the drive, and ask, “Are you happy in your course, child? Are you
                      still writing? Keep at it. Stay true to your art.” I would muster all my courage and mumble about
                      what I’ve been doing.
                      <br><br>
                      Sister G knew every person on the support staff by name and her generosity overflowed,
                      especially towards those who rarely received it. She often asked about their children, whether
                      they had eaten that day, why they looked weary, why they lacked bangles on their wrists or if
                      they were wearing a new saree. Besides her renowned philanthropy, it was Sister&#39;s attention to
                      the little things that made all the difference to people and continues to touch our hearts.
                      <br><br>
                      On one of my earlier encounters with Sister, I recall breaking into a chain of complaints &quot;But
                      Sister, there is so much talent in my class. How can I not get lost in a class of 100? You keep
                      asking me about my writing but I don&#39;t know what it accounts for for me to continue.&quot; Had I
                      grown too comfortable expressing these concerns on a campus where 2,800 girls had twice as
                      many worries? Perhaps. Did Sister ever make me feel like my concern was not valid? Never.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <p class="para">
                          She promised it was enough if I could stay true to myself, be the most well-read in the room, and
                          settle on a kinder heart. By the start of year two, I&#39;d learnt to use my newly found voice fairly for
                          myself. The next order of business for Sister was to make sure I used this voice for others who
                          could use a hand.<br><br>
                          Not fast enough, I found myself at the apex of the student council. Me? President of a student
                          union? Oh, what an impact you had on me, Sister. I often wondered if my voice would fade
                          without someone who believed in me so strongly. But you know what they say about trees, yes?
                          If the roots are strong, there is no wind that it cannot waver. Sister was our roots.
                          <br><br>
                          You might wonder why the administrator of such a large institution took such a keen interest in
                          the life of a single girl entering her college. Well, it wasn&#39;t just me. Everyone Sister spoke to felt
                          just as loved and seen. Imagine what that does for a group of insecure teenagers venturing into
                          the adult world.
                          <br><br>
                          I graduated pre-university and made it to degree. I learnt that when I&#39;m given love, I must learn
                          to give back twofold, and so I began to settle into the whirlwind that degree is. But even if you&#39;re
                          calm in the storm, when you hit the eye, it is only human to waver. It was no coincidence that
                          when I did, I would run into Sister Genevieve and her familiar &quot;What are you doing new
                          nowadays child? Are you still writing? Keep at it. Stay true to your art. Stay true to yourself.”
                          <br><br>
                          She was truly a godsend. I say that in a way that she was such a constant in our lives that it never
                          hit us that she could ever leave us. But so she did. Rest in power, Sister G.
                          This is not a goodbye, this is a thank you for sharing your life with us.
