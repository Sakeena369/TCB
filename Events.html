              beginnings, and new expectations</h2>
            <p>A formal investiture ceremony was hosted at Mount Carmel College on July 22, 2023 to honor the newly elected student council. With a hush of excitement and nervousness, the student Council and association secretaries were finally ready to be formally invested with their duties in the prestigious DJB Auditorium!

              <br><br>Opening the ceremony with the traditional ‘Lighting of the Lamp’ ceremony marked the start of new beginnings. The ceremony followed suit with the introductions of the newly elected members who were given badges to represent their power and responsibility.
              
              <br><br>Attending the event as the Chief Guest was the Commissioner of Income Tax, Vandana Ramachandra, who is notably also an alumna of the college. Her speech directed to the student council members encouraged them to have a positive influence on the larger community. Jain University and Sheshadripuram Degree College, who were invited as guests, paid a debut to the new council with their presence. 
              
              <br><br>The event continued with numerous college associations such as the Kannada Sangha, the Street Dance Association and the Western Dance Association giving spectacular performances. The event was exclusive to the newly elected leaders, the parents of the council members and third-year students from the campus. The closing remarks for the ceremony were given by Dr. George Lekha, the principal of Mount Carmel College, in a powerful speech. 
              
              <br><br>Just like the badges of responsibility sealed the position of each leader, the ceremony gave the students, and faculty a chance to recognize and applaud the newly elected student council.

              <p class="text-lighter">The 77th Independence Day celebrations were held in Mount Carmel College, Bengaluru, to honor the spirit of freedom and unity. The event was held at the DJB auditorium.

              <br><br>The event commenced with readings of the holy scriptures, the Quran, Bhagavad Gita, Bible and Guru Granth Sahib. Lt Gen. Ramesh Kulkarni, the chief guest, was present at the event with his wife and daughter. He was awarded a token of appreciation for his service in the Indian Army. “Very happy to see life on campus, excited to see how everybody will turn out in the future” addressed Lt Gen. Kulkarni. He also spoke of the book he co-wrote with his daughter, Anjali Karpe - Siachen, 1987: Battle for the Frozen Frontier, a memoir of the lieutenant's time as the commander of the infantry division.
              
              <br><br>There were performances by the Western Music Association (WMA), the Kannada Sangha, and the Indian Music Association (IMA.) A pipping ceremony was held to rank the NCC cadets. The program concluded with performances by NCC cadets, NSS and the Indian dance association. 
              
              <br><br> Keerthi, a first-year student shared her experience about the event. “I personally come from an army background, so it felt like home to me to see the chief guest from the army, address the students,” she stated. 
              
              <br><br> The celebration aimed to express gratitude to those who have fought for our freedom.

              </h2>
              <p> For Bhavana, a 21-year-old student at MCC, providing for animals has always been a cause close to her heart. She speaks to Saranyaa Ramesh about channeling her love of animals into her passion project. 

                <br><br>Bhavana’s love and enthusiasm does not go unnoticed in our Zoom call. She sits down to talk to me after having rescued a kitten. Growing up surrounded by a variety of animals from turtles to mice, she has taken care of any animal that comes her way. After graduating from high school, she wanted to pursue veterinary science but could not due to various reasons. This, however, fuelled the desire to pursue her passion further. 
                In her gap years, she began dog walking and grooming her dogs - Spark and Moon. Her work attracted positive attention from onlookers and through word of mouth, she began her journey of pet grooming. 
                
                <br><br>When asked about her favorite memory, Bhavana smiled ear to ear while talking about it - the first dog that she groomed, Shiro. “The owner told me that Shiro is very aggressive, and hates getting his nails cut. But the dog behaved so well with me, and the owners were taken aback,” she said. 
                
                <br><br>Bhavana believes that the pet grooming industry has a lot of potential. “I’d love to open my grooming center” she mentioned when asked about her plans. She currently works in marketing at a pet food company and wishes to start her line of pet treats.  
                
                <br><br>Taking on various roles of being a college student, an entrepreneur, an animal activist and so much more, Bhavana is all set to take on the world. Kindled by her unwavering affection for animals, she has taken the first stride toward inspiring an impactful change in the world.

              <p> The Political Science department students conducted a mass protest with the Student Federation of India (SFI) at Freedom Park on July 28 to mark 10 years of undued justice for 17-year-old Soujanya. 
                <br><br>The family members of Soujanya, whose body was found near Dharmasthala on October 9, 2012, urged the State government to reinvestigate her rape and murder case. College students who joined this cause demanded accountability from those responsible and persuaded the authorities to take swift and unbiased actions. 
                <br><br>“Justice has been denied for the last 10 years and proper investigation has not been done. There are a lot of examples like Nirbhaya’s case and the recent Manipur issue. Why is the system taking so much time to get the culprit into custody? Is it because of political influence or money power?”, says Kusuma, a student of MCC. 
                <br><br>Not only students, but activists from across the country stand united with the victim’s family and their decision to hand over the case to a special investigation team. Lalita, a social activist, confirmed “We are not going to stop. This is only the beginning. We are asking to reinvestigate properly, and we are going to continue this till the real culprit is not caught and punished”. 
                <br><br>The Mount Carmel students joined this protest with the aim to emphasize the need for fair and transparent investigations of unjust cases like these.

              </h2>
              <p> The sixty-plus associations and clubs of Mount Carmel College came out in full force on July 25th and 26th with the Association Sign-Up Drive. The rain may have delayed the drive by an hour but the rain can kill plans, never spirits. 
               <br><br> With the rain slowing down to a drizzle, students crowded in front of the associations of their choice. The associations did their best to attract students through various means, with both the Indian and Street Dance Associations putting on a show. The former  did an impromptu “mini workshops” to pull students. Face painting by the Journalism Association; a “venting spot” with a punching bag set up by the Dramatics Association; banners offering free hugs were some of the interactive activities set up by the associations. Engagement between associations and students was plentiful, with the latter being enthusiastic about the wide range of choices.
               <br><br>The first years were especially eager to explore this extravaganza of opportunity and signed up for multiple clubs on the first day itself. Prisha and Jade, first-year students from Media Studies, said that the sign-up drive was ‘insane’ and that they had a lot of fun signing up for multiple associations.
